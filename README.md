## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have always been interested in learning about finances, since to me, this is something that can be very useful for personal and professional development. I really want to know how money works and how I can make an intelligent financial decision; that's something I'd like to be good at doing. All the same, programming attracts me despite it being pretty tough. It's interesting to see how coding can be applied in solutions and automate tasks, but it's definitely a steep learning curve for me.
I am currently working on self-improvementâ€”be it learning new things, time management, or developing good habits. I want to develop capabilities in different aspects of life. Growth is an area I'm investing in, knowing it will pay off in the long run.

My favorite hobby outside of academics and self-improvement is probably playing video games. It is something that I really enjoy, as it helps me relax, but it also inspires my creativity. I will always wonder how a game was designed and coded, which is one of the reasons I want to learn more about programming. Balancing my interests with my goals keeps me motivated to keep learning and growing.
